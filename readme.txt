Instructions for Use:

The Widget and the Custom Post Type
The widget displays up to four posts from the custom post type that it created in a set order, and will also display the featured image for each post. To add a post to the custom post type, go on the WordPress Dashboard and click the 'Design' menu item. Then click the 'Add New' button next to the page name, write up your post and click the publish button when you're done! When adding posts to the custom post type, remember to set a featured image as well. After all this, you should be able to see your post displayed in the widget.

To set this widget so that it appears on your website, go to 'Appearance' -> 'Widgets' and drag the widget titled 'Custom Posts' to your desired widget area. You can also specify the title that you want the widget to have when it appears on your site and then hit the 'Save' button.
